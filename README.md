This is a React leaderboard that can toggle between Recent Top Scores and Alltime Top Scores. It uses the fetch API to get the data from two different paths of the same API. It then conditionally renders the data, depending on which list you want to see.

The node modules folder is not included, but you can see what dependencies were used in the package.json file.
