This is a React leaderboard that can toggle between Recent Top Scores and Alltime Top Scores. It uses the fetch API to get the data from two different paths of the same API. It then conditionally renders the data, depending on which list you want to see.

This project was styled using only simple CSS and Bootstrap.

The node modules folder is not included, but you can see what dependencies were used in the package.json file. The final build is located in the dist folder
